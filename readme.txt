Thanks for downloading our OBD2 data pack!

This pack contains the following:
1) Our OBD2 Intro & Data Logger articles in PDF form
2) Our OBD2 DBC file (for both 11-bit CAN IDs and 29-bit CAN IDs)
3) Various OBD2 sample log files - incl. an extensive one from a SEAT Leon
4) A collection of reverse-engineered DBC files, primarily from the opendbc github repo


You can open the MF4 log files e.g. in below software tools and use the OBD2 DBC to decode the data:

1) asammdf GUI: Good starting point for opening, DBC decoding and plotting the data
- Introduction: https://www.csselectronics.com/screen/page/asammdf-gui-api-mdf4
- Docs & download: https://canlogger.csselectronics.com/canedge-getting-started/log-file-tools/asammdf-gui/

2) Python API: Automate the processing of the data
- Introduction: https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/python-can-bus-api
- Docs & code examples: https://canlogger.csselectronics.com/canedge-getting-started/log-file-tools/api-tools/

3) Grafana dashboards: Create custom dashboard visualizations of the data
- Introduction: https://www.csselectronics.com/screen/page/telematics-dashboard-open-source
- Docs & code examples: https://canlogger.csselectronics.com/canedge-getting-started/log-file-tools/browser-dashboards/
- OBD2 dashboard 'playground': https://grafana.csselectronics.stellarhosted.com/d/6qvL9OvMz/css-playground-obd2

4) MF4 converters: Ideal if you want to work with the log files in e.g. Vector/PEAK tools
- Introduction: https://www.csselectronics.com/screen/page/mdf4-converters-mf4-asc-csv
- Docs & code examples: https://canlogger.csselectronics.com/canedge-getting-started/log-file-tools/mdf4-converters/
